# IMPORTANT: always run tests via `bun run test` (the package script), NOT via
# `bun test apps/api` from the monorepo root. The package script runs service/
# middleware tests and route tests in separate bun processes to prevent
# mock.module() from leaking between unit tests and route integration tests.
