# Gravity Room

> Free web app for structured weightlifting programs with automatic progression. Train smarter — the app tells you exactly what to do each session and adjusts weight, sets, and reps based on your performance.

## About

Gravity Room is a training tracker that implements science-backed weightlifting programs with built-in progressive overload. Instead of guessing in the gym, users follow structured programs where the app automatically increases weight when they succeed and adjusts the load when they fail.

Key features:

- Automatic weight progression based on performance
- Multiple training programs (GZCLP, and more added regularly)
- Statistics and strength curves over time
- Cloud sync across devices
- Calendar integration for scheduling workouts
- 100% free

## How It Works

1. **Choose a program** — Pick a training program that fits your goals and set your starting weights.
2. **Follow the plan** — Each workout tells you exactly what to do: exercise, sets, reps, and weight.
3. **Progress automatically** — Complete your reps and the weight goes up. Fail, and the program adapts intelligently.

## Training Programs

Gravity Room offers a catalog of structured training programs with periodization. Programs include:

- **GZCLP** — A popular linear progression program using a tier system (T1/T2/T3) with different set/rep schemes per tier.
- Additional programs are added regularly across categories: strength, hypertrophy, and powerlifting.

All programs feature automatic progression rules, deload protocols, and stage-based adaptation.
